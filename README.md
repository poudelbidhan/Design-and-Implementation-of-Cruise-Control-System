# Design-and-Synthesis-of-Cruise-Control-System

In this project, we familiarize ourselves with the basics of synthesis using design Vision through a simple example "cruise control design". After synthesis, we will do a pre-layout static timing analysis of our synthesized design. We will define constraints for our design and check the timing of all the paths in the design. In the final part, we will use the synthesized Verilog netlist to perform "Place and Route" the circuit on a die.
